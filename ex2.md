The command ls lists the contents of the current directoryâ€”it tells you what files you have.  With a -l option it  gives
       a  long  listing,  that  includes  the  owner and size and date of the file, and the permissions people have for reading
       and/or changing the file.  For example, the file "tel" here is 37 bytes long, owned by aeb and the owner  can  read  and
       write it, others can only read it.  Owner and permissions can be changed by the commands chown and chmod.
